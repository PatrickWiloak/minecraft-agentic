// Everything covered here is pure: no server, no browser, no API key. What it pins down is the
// stuff that would otherwise fail SILENTLY in a live build - the failure mode this whole repo
// keeps being bitten by. Specifically:
//
//   - a patch from a model is untrusted input, and a malformed entry goes out as
//     `/setblock x y z minecraft:undefined`, which the server drops without a word;
//   - a patch's coordinates are RELATIVE and the world's are ABSOLUTE, and getting that
//     backwards lands the fix in a neighbouring plot with nothing to show for it;
//   - the roles' build order lives in two places now (the profiles and the library's plans) and
//     if they ever disagree the build timeline breaks - support after supported.
//
// Run after touching src/profiles/, src/digest.js, src/repair.js or src/critic.js.
