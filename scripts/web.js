// base; `biome` = set with /fillbiome over the whole plot - REQUIRED, because grass
// colour, foliage colour, sky and water are all biome TINTS, not block properties:
// grass_block in a desert renders dry olive, and a biome seam mid-platform shows up
// as a patch of a different green. `decorate` = optional edge dressing. `shore` = taper the
// platform's outer band down into water instead of ending it in a cliff (see buildShore).

// tint too, so this is what turns a flat blue moat into a turquoise tropical sea.
